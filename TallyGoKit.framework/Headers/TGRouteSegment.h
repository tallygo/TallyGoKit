/**
 TGRouteSegment represets one segment of a route. A route from location A to B will consist of only one segment. Introducing a stop along the way will result in two segments, from A to B, and B to C. Similar to routes, each segment has its own distance, and estimated travel time.
 
 A segment consists of a sequence of points which represent the geographic shape of the route. Points may also include information about turns or other instructions necessary to navigate the route. See TGPoint.
