/**
 TGPoint represents a specific location along the route, and may also contain data important at that location.
 
 Points occur at locations considered important for any of these reasons:
 - Start and end points of a segment
 - Geographic significance, like a bend in the road
 - A location that requires navigation instructions to be given to the driver. Refer to notify and say memebrs.
 - An intersection. If the driver needs to make a turn, the turn property contains information about the action the driver should take.
